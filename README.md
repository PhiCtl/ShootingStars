#Project 1: Linear systems

*Philippine des Courtils, Stella Petronio*

The project consists in the implementation of several direct and iterative methods for the solution of the linear systems using Matrix operations. More precisely, regarding the direct methods we focused on the **LU factorization** and the **Cholesky factorization** and for the iterative ones we concentrated on the splitting methods **Jacobi** and **Gauss-Seidel** and then on the **Conjugate Gradient** and **Richardson** methods.
